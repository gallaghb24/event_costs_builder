2. **Check Core/OAB assignments**: Ensure each job is correctly classified
3. **Verify costs**: Review the preview before generating the final invoice
4. **Save templates**: Keep your template file updated with current client names
5. **Batch processing**: Process multiple jobs at once by pasting all data

## Troubleshooting
